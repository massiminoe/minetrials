"""Fold a bench run's harness transcripts into one usage.json.

The token ledger of a run — what it cost to earn its advancements. Reads
whatever transcript the run's harness left in `harness/` and writes a compact
summary next to score.json, so cost analysis never has to re-download hundreds
of MB of transcript.

One output schema, three parsers — a benchmark entry is (harness, model), and
cost per advancement has to be comparable across harnesses. Which parser runs is
decided by `--kind` (default: the `harness` field of the run's metadata.json,
falling back to claude-code, so every pre-existing run re-parses identically).

**claude-code** (`claude-*.jsonl`, stream-json). Two things about the source
format are load-bearing:

1. **Only the `result` event is authoritative.** The per-message `usage` blocks
   on `assistant` events are mid-stream snapshots — there are more of them than
   there are turns, and summing them overcounts cache reads while undercounting
   output (measured on one run: 37.8M/2.4k summed vs the result event's
   23.0M/91.8k). So we take the LAST `result` event in each file and ignore the
   rest.
2. **Each invocation's result is its own, not cumulative.** The harness loop
   re-enters with `--continue`, so every claude-N.jsonl shares a session id but
   reports only the tokens that invocation spent. Summing across files is
   therefore correct, not double-counting.

**opencode** (`opencode-*.jsonl`, `--format json`). Usage rides on `step_finish`
events: `part.cost` in USD plus `part.tokens {input, output, reasoning,
cache:{read, write}}`. These are per-step (one LLM request), so they sum — the
`steps` and `last_step` fields on each per-invocation entry exist so that
assumption stays checkable against a real transcript rather than trusted. The
cost figure is the same number opencode Zen meters the Go plan's dollar caps
against, so this file doubles as quota tracking.

**cursor** (`cursor-usage.json`, written by the harness from `agent.getUsage()`).
The Cursor CLI's own stream-json carries no usage at all, which is why that
harness drives the SDK instead. `rawCostCents` is the undiscounted model cost —
the right analogue of Claude Code's list-price number, and the one that stays
meaningful under a subscription; `chargedCents` (0 for plan-included usage) is
kept alongside it as `charged_usd`.

Health matters as much as the totals. A harness that got throttled scores low
for reasons that have nothing to do with the model, so rate-limit signals are
tallied and a hard rejection sets `health.throttled` — the flag analysis uses to
quarantine a trial instead of silently averaging it in.

`cost_basis` names what the cost figure actually is: a list-price equivalent, a
gateway's metered charge, or a vendor's raw cost. Runs authenticated with a
subscription are not billed per token; the token counts are real either way.
